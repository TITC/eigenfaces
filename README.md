# eigenfaces

Implementation of Eigenfaces face recognition using PCA.

All images must be the same size and converted to grayscale.
Each person/class must have his/her own folder, and every photo of a given
person must be placed into the same folder, and the folder must be given the
person/class's name.

The algorithm is run from the main.py module.
When run, the algorithm will print the predicted classification to the console
and will show the picture.
